# Jessica's Fantatic Email Regex Matching Guide

Welcome one and all to this comprehensive guide on matching email regular expressions (regex) using JavaSCript inthe field of Computer Science! Upon completing this tutorial, both newbies and those with a bit of experience under their belts as well, will have a clear(er) comprehension and understanding of regex compontents. In the tutorial, we're going to dive headfirst into email regex, breaking down the pattern designed to validate an email address and explainhow all of the parts contribute to making sure email validation is both accurate and most importantly, reliable.

## Summary

The featured regular expression (regex) as seen below, will be referenced for analysis in regards to each reged component to ensure new-comers and seasoned developers alike are able to understand and grasp material with absolute clarity. The regex components discussed are going to include: anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, and character escapes.

The Regex Featured in this Tutorial Below:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Regular expressions are useful tools for matching patterns in text. Anchors are special characters in regular expressions, and they play an essential role in defining the position of the pattern within the input string. It is crucial to ensure the entire input string matched the specified pattern.

The Two Main Types of Anchors:
1. Start Anchor ^: This asserts that the pattern must match the start of the string.
2. End Anchor $: This asserts that the pattern must match the end of the string.

Anchors basically define the boundaries of the text that the regex should match.
Example One: The regex ^hello$ matches only the string "hello" and nothing else. So if you were to try matching it with "hello world" or "say hello" because the pattern is not the at the start or end of the string. 
Example Two: The regex ^hello matches any string where "hello" is at the start of the string. It will match "hello" in "hello world", bot it will not not match "hello" in "world hello" becasuse the string does not start with "hello".
Example Three: The regex hello$ matchs any string where "hello" is at the end of the string. It will match "hello" in "world hello" but not with "hello" in "hello world" becuase the string does not end with "hello".

In the scenario of email validation, anchors are invaluable because they help ensure that the entire email address adheres to the specified pattern. This is extremely important for accurate validation, because it prevents partial matches or unwanted results. By setting boundaries at the start and end of the string, anchors guarantee that the pattern matches only the intended text. These are critical components of pattern matching in text processing, particulary when validating email addresses using a regex like /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. In conclusion, anchors play a vital role in defining the position within the input string and ensures accurate and reliable validation
